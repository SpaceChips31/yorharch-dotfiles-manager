# YoRHarch â€” Dotfiles Command Unit
> "Everything that lives is designed to end."  
> Yet configuration lives on.
---

A lightweight tool I made to manage and edit my dotfiles. 
Born as part of my Arch installation, called **YoRHarch**, mainly inspired by the aesthetic of **NieR:Automata**.
Since my Arch installation is inspired by NieR, I decided to call it YoRHarch.

- Simple GUI (Based on Dear ImGUI);
- Edit any dotfile with configurable paths;
- Change theme easily by swapping groups of dotfiles; 
- Designed to be minimal and fast.

## Planned Features

- Modular dotfiles management;
- Realtime editing;
- Visual preview of backups;
- Themes support;
- Sync with git repositories.
